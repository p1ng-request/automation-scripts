**Strategy**: e.g. let's do a quick Google search

A quick glance, the user should know:
+ Your brand
+ Keywords representing the highlighted features
+ Does the keyword represent the features of the product that the founder would like to highlight?
+ Does the tagline tell the user that the product can satisfy their need?

**Scope/Structure/Skeleton**: In practical terms, there are two types of products (web pages) for Docs.
+ Informational
  + People browse it for the content. It could be a product docs, API docs, onboarding (integration) docs, SASS docs, community docs.
+ What matters is the *information architecture*, which involves
    + DIR structure (backend side) 
    + URL structure (needs to be comprehensive and SEO friendly)
    + Navbar
    + Sidebar
    + Content structure for the Overview page
    + User browsing journey
+ Functional
  + e.g. https://clickup.com/features/automations 
+ People are looking for a solution to their specific needs and stumble upon this page.
+ The landing page needs to explain what this feature / set of features can do to complete a specific task for the user.
  + Be interactive. The documentation engineer needs to think and design as both a copywriter and a front-end programmer.

## Best practices
### Get constant feedback from your readers.
The best readers you can get are the developers on your team. Do some quick interviews with them, asking questions such as
+ Do you think that this part of the doc is easy to understand?
+ Is there any information missing?
+ etc.

### Use data analytics for improvement
Data Analystics: Google Analytics is the one stop shop solution for this step. It provides data for:
+ Total user counts
+ New users
+ Engeagment time
+ Traffic source
+ Country
+ Top viewed pages
+ CTR
+ Bounce rate
+ User retention
+ User demographic
+ etc.

### Perform User tests

### Improve your Docs search performance using SEO techniques

### Content writing enforcement
+ Produce a general writing style gudieline
+ Create a terminlogy list
+ Create writing samples (tempaltes) for content enforcement
+ *Use Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence Technologies for automted content workflow*
